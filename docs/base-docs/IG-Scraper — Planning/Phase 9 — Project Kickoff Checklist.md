# Phase 9 — Project Kickoff Checklist

## Purpose of This Phase

This phase translates all previous planning phases into a **clear, actionable checklist**.

Its goal is to answer one question:

> “What exactly do I do next, and in what order?”

No technical implementation is performed here.

---

## Repository Initialization

- The repository will be created as **public from day one**
- Transparency and openness are intentional from the start

---

## Initial Commit Strategy

The first commit will include **documentation only**, specifically:

- README
- All planning phase documents (Phase 0 → Phase 9)

No code or project skeleton is included in the initial commit.

This establishes clarity and intent before implementation.

---

## Project Naming

- The project name is finalized as: **IG-Scraper**
- The name is explicit, descriptive, and suitable for an open-source npm library
- No rebranding is planned at this stage

---

## Pre-Code Project Setup

Before writing any code, the following will be set up:

- License
- Code of Conduct
- Contribution guidelines
- GitHub Issue templates
- Pull Request template

All governance and collaboration rules are established upfront.

---

## Decision Tracking

- A **Decision Log** will exist from day one
- All major architectural or behavioral decisions will be recorded
- This prevents ambiguity and repeated discussions

---

## Technical Planning Priorities (Before Coding)

When technical planning begins, priorities are:

1. Session model
2. Public API design
3. Data targets
4. Error model

This order reflects dependency and impact.

---

## Transition to Implementation

Implementation begins:

- Immediately after completing Phase 9
- Without additional planning phases
- With full confidence in the established direction

---

## Pre-Coding Checklist

A **pre-coding checklist** is required before starting implementation to ensure:

- Repository structure is ready
- Documentation is committed
- Governance rules are active
- Release strategy is understood

---

## Work Rhythm

Development will proceed:

- In **batches**
- With intentional focus
- Without rushed timelines

This supports long-term sustainability.

---

## Project Longevity

IG-Scraper is treated as a **long-term project**, not a short-lived experiment.

Design, decisions, and maintenance reflect this commitment.

---

## Phase Status

**Phase 9 — Project Kickoff: COMPLETE**

All planning phases are now complete.

---

## Planning Summary

The project has successfully completed:

- Phase 0 — Foundation
- Phase 1 — Vision & Scope
- Phase 2 — Governance
- Phase 3 — Project Structure
- Phase 4 — High-Level Technical Decisions
- Phase 5 — Risks, Ethics & Responsibility
- Phase 6 — Developer Experience
- Phase 7 — Release Strategy
- Phase 8 — Documentation Structure
- Phase 9 — Project Kickoff

**Planning is finished. Execution can begin with confidence.**
