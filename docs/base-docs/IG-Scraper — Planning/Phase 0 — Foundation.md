# Phase 0 — Foundation

## Project Context

This project exists because of a **real, personal need**.

The maintainer required a modern, flexible npm library capable of scraping Instagram data **without relying on the official API**, and no existing solution met that need in a satisfactory, up-to-date way.

As a result, this library was created to solve a real problem before attempting to serve a broader audience.

---

## Primary User

The **first and primary user of this library is the maintainer himself**.

All early decisions, APIs, and features are driven by:

- Real usage
- Practical needs
- Actual workflows

If a feature is not useful to the maintainer, it is not required at this stage.

---

## Ownership & Decision Model

This project follows a **founder-led open-source model**.

- The maintainer is the final decision maker.
- The project is not community-driven in its early stages.
- External ideas, issues, and pull requests are welcome **after release**, but acceptance is always subject to the maintainer’s judgment.

This model ensures clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability.

---

## Feature Philosophy

Features are added only when:

- They solve a real problem
- They are required by actual usage
- Their value is clearly justified

The project avoids:

- Feature bloat
- Premature abstractions
- Large speculative roadmaps

**Principle:**

Build what is needed, not what is impressive.

## Open-Source Evolution

Initial phase:

- Tight scope
- Strong control
- Clear vision

Post-release:

- Community feedback is encouraged
- Contributions may be accepted
- Collaboration is possible under defined rules

Growth is intentional, not uncontrolled.

---

## Project Definition (High-Level)

This project is an open-source npm library designed to enable developers to extract Instagram data without using the official API, while prioritizing clarity, responsibility, and developer experience.

This definition is intentionally high-level and will be refined in later phases.

---

## Red Lines (Non-Goals)

This project explicitly does **not** aim to:

- Act as a hacking or exploitation tool
- Guarantee immunity from bans or detection
- Promote illegal or unethical behavior
- “Break” or aggressively bypass Instagram protections
- Make misleading or unrealistic promises

These boundaries are intentional and non-negotiable.
