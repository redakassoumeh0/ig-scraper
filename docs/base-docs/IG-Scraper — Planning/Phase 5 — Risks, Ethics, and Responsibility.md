# Phase 5 — Risks, Ethics, and Responsibility

## Purpose of This Phase

This phase defines the project’s official position regarding:

- Ethical usage
- User responsibility
- Legal and operational risks
- Abuse prevention boundaries

This document exists to protect:

- The project
- Its maintainers
- Its users

Clarity and transparency are intentional.

---

## Ethics & Responsibility Placement

Ethics and responsibility guidelines are provided through:

- A **dedicated documentation page**
- A **clear summary section in the README**

This ensures visibility without overwhelming the entry point.

---

## Project Intent

This project exists to:

- Solve a real, practical problem
- Help developers extract data responsibly
- Enable building products and systems on top of this library

It is not built for exploitation, abuse, or platform manipulation.

---

## Acceptable Use

The following use cases are considered acceptable:

- Analytics for accounts you own or manage
- Monitoring public pages for legitimate purposes
- Internal dashboards and reporting systems
- Research, testing, and controlled experimentation

These examples are not exhaustive, but indicative.

---

## Unacceptable Use

The following uses are explicitly prohibited:

- Harassment or stalking
- Mass surveillance of individuals or groups
- Credential theft or account compromise
- Spam or automation actions (posting, liking, messaging, etc.)
- Any usage intended to harm individuals, organizations, or platforms

Requests or contributions enabling such behavior will not be supported.

---

## Data Access & Scope

The library does not technically restrict the type of data that can be extracted, as long as it is technically possible.

However:

- A **strong responsibility warning** is always present
- Users are expected to make ethical decisions
- Misuse is the user’s responsibility, not the project’s

---

## Data & Privacy Principles

Users are strongly encouraged to follow these principles:

- Do not collect sensitive personal data
- Do not track or profile individuals
- Do not store more data than necessary
- Avoid long-term or unnecessary retention of scraped data

These are ethical expectations, not technical guarantees.

---

## Platform Risk Disclosure

Documentation will clearly state that:

- Accounts or IPs may be restricted or banned
- Platform behavior may change without notice
- All usage is performed at the user’s own risk

No safety guarantees are made.

---

## Responsible Use Guidelines

The documentation includes responsible usage guidance, such as:

- Avoid excessive load
- Use delays where appropriate
- Act conservatively and intentionally
- Respect platform boundaries, even when using unofficial methods

Guidelines are clear but not overly verbose.

---

## Handling Abuse Requests

If an Issue or discussion clearly requests abusive or unethical functionality:

- It will be closed immediately
- The contributor will be redirected to this policy

No extended discussion is required in such cases.

---

## Pull Requests & Abuse

While there is no blanket statement rejecting all potentially sensitive PRs, any contribution that enables abuse or violates this policy will be rejected.

Alignment with this document is mandatory.

---

## Legal & Disclaimer Positioning

The project includes **strong and explicit disclaimers**, including:

- This project is not affiliated with Instagram or Meta
- No warranty of any kind is provided
- Usage is entirely at the user’s own risk

This language is intentional and firm.

---

## Transparency Statement

This project prioritizes:

- Clear communication
- Honest limitations
- Explicit responsibility boundaries

There are no hidden behaviors or misleading claims.

---

## Phase Status

**Phase 5 — Risks, Ethics, and Responsibility: COMPLETE**

All ethical, risk, and responsibility positions are now locked.
