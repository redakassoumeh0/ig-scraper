# Phase 2 — Governance & Contribution Model

## Governance Model

This project follows a **founder-led governance model**.

- The founder is the final decision maker.
- Decisions are authoritative by default.
- In the future, additional maintainers may be granted **equal decision-making authority**, but only by explicit appointment.

The project is not democratic by default.

---

## Scope Enforcement

Any contribution that falls **outside the defined project scope** is rejected by default.

Contributors are explicitly encouraged to:

- Fork the project
- Build additional or experimental functionality in separate repositories

This repository remains intentionally focused.

---

## Issues & Feature Requests

The project may accept:

- Issues
- Discussions
- Pull Requests

Acceptance depends on the current state and priorities of the project.

All feature requests must:

- Be clearly described
- Follow a defined request format
- Stay within the declared scope

Vague or out-of-scope requests are rejected.

---

## Pull Request Policy

- Pull Requests **without an Issue** are allowed only for:
  - The founder
  - Explicitly assigned maintainers
- All other contributors must link PRs to an existing Issue.

This rule ensures clarity, traceability, and controlled evolution.

---

## Pull Request Rejection Criteria

A Pull Request may be rejected if it introduces any of the following:

- Increased complexity without clear justification
- Scope expansion
- Poor or missing documentation
- Maintenance burden
- Misalignment with project philosophy

Rejection does not imply poor code quality — only misalignment.

---

## Quality Standards

Code quality and update responsiveness are considered **equally important**.

The project does not trade long-term maintainability for short-term speed, nor vice versa.

All contributions must:

- Preserve API simplicity
- Respect architectural boundaries
- Remain maintainable under frequent Instagram changes

---

## API Stability & Simplicity

Any Pull Request that compromises API simplicity or pushes the project outside its scope is rejected immediately.

Contributors are free to:

- Modify the library privately
- Extend it in separate repositories

This repository remains intentionally constrained.

---

## Communication Style

The project communication tone is:

- Simple
- Direct
- Explicit

No unnecessary formality. No ambiguity.

---

## Conflict Resolution

Clear rules are established to minimize conflict.

If disagreement arises:

- Discussion is encouraged within defined boundaries
- Rules may be adjusted if discussion leads to a fundamental shift in understanding
- Final decisions remain authoritative

---

## Maintainers & Continuity

To ensure long-term reliability, especially given frequent Instagram changes:

- The project may include multiple maintainers
- This reduces single-point-of-failure risk
- Maintainers are expected to align with the project philosophy

---

## Decision Documentation

All major decisions are documented via a **Decision Log**.

This ensures:

- Transparency
- Historical context
- Reduced repetitive discussions

---

## Phase Status

**Phase 2 — Governance & Contribution Model: COMPLETE**

Governance rules are now locked and serve as the foundation for all future collaboration.
